tail -f /var/log/apache2/access.log

By default, tail will output the last 10 lines of its input to the standard output. With command line options, the amount of output and the units (lines, blocks or bytes) may be changed.



In versions of PHP below 5.3, we would be able to terminate our request with a null byte (%00) that would cause the PHP engine to ignore everything after that byte.
